# LexiCo
### A simple lexer+parser+AST
Implemented the lexer from scratch, also using regular expressions. Inorder to understand the woking of a lexical analyzer and how it connects with a parser.

### OTHER FEATURES TO ADD MAYBE IN FUTURE
1. Support for other operators like unary(!x, -x)
2. support for floating digits and scientific notaitns
3. keywords like if, while
4. conditional expressions
